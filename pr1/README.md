### 1. Basic Building Blocks

In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
5 + 7 and press Enter

``` r
5+7
```

    [1] 12

To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x \<-
5 + 7. This can be read as ‘x gets 5 plus 7’. Give it a try now.

``` r
x <- 5+7
```

To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try
it now.

``` r
x
```

    [1] 12

Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

``` r
y <- x - 3
```

What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

``` r
y
```

    [1] 9

The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which
stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’. To create a vector containing the
numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the
result in a variable called z.

``` r
z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
```

Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access
R’s built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want
more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses
that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

``` r
?c
```

Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating
the values in the output.

``` r
z
```

    [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that
contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don’t assign this vector to
a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

``` r
c(z, 555, z)
```

    [1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the
following to see what happens: z \* 2 + 100.

``` r
z*2+100
```

    [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called
my_sqrt.

``` r
my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1)
```

Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think
it contains? 2: a vector of length 3 Print the contents of my_sqrt.

``` r
my_sqrt
```

    [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z
divided by my_sqrt.

``` r
my_div <- z/my_sqrt
```

Which statement do you think is true? 2: The first element of my_div is
equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt,
and so on… Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

``` r
my_div
```

    [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

To see another example of how this vector ‘recycling’ works, try adding
c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don’t worry about saving the result in a new
variable.

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
```

    [1]  1 12  3 14

Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
```

    Warning in c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100): длина большего объекта не является
    произведением длины меньшего объекта

    [1]   1  12 103   4

In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through
previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you
get to this command (z \* 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit
Enter. If the up arrow doesn’t work for you, just type the corrected
command.

``` r
z*2+1000
```

    [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the
Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will
provide a list of variables that you’ve created that begin with ‘my’.
This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many
variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn’t
work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

``` r
my_div
```

### 1. Basic Building Blocks

Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working
directory using getwd().

``` r
getwd()
```

    [1] "C:/Users/alexk/OneDrive/Documents"

List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

Assign 9 to x using x \<- 9.

``` r
x <- 9
```

Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or
dir().

``` r
dir()
```

     [1] "1.html"                         "1.qmd"                         
     [3] "1.rmarkdown"                    "1_files"

     [7] "Audacity"                       "Avalanche Studios"             
     [9] "Battlefield 1"                  "Battlefield 2042"              
    [11] "Battlefield V"                  "BioWare"                       
    [13] "BlackSquad"                     "Custom Office Templates"       
    [15] "DeadIslandDE"                   "desktop.ini"                   
    [17] "EA Games"                       "FormatFactory"                 
    [19] "IISExpress"                     "Larian Studios"                
    [21] "My Cheat Tables"                "My Games"

    [25] "Project CARS"                   "README.md"                     
    [27] "Rockstar Games"                 "Telltale Games"

As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for
each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the
command ?list.files.

``` r
?list.files
```

Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

``` r
args(list.files)
```

    function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
        recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
        no.. = FALSE) 
    NULL

Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called
“old.dir”.

``` r
old.dir <- getwd()
```

Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory
called “testdir”.

``` r
dir.create("testdir")
```

    Warning in dir.create("testdir"): 'testdir' уже существует

Set your working directory to “testdir” with the setwd() command.

``` r
setwd("testdir")
```

Create a file in your working directory called “mytest.R” using the
file.create() function.

``` r
file.create("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let’s
check this by listing all the files in the current directory.

``` r
list.files()
```

     [1] "1.html"                         "1.qmd"                         
     [3] "1.rmarkdown"                    "1_files"                       
     [5] "Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag" "Assassin's Creed Odyssey"      
     [7] "Audacity"                       "Avalanche Studios"             
     [9] "Battlefield 1"                  "Battlefield 2042"              
    [11] "Battlefield V"                  "BioWare"                       
    [13] "BlackSquad"                     "Custom Office Templates"       
    [15] "DeadIslandDE"                   "desktop.ini"                   
    [17] "EA Games"                       "FormatFactory"                 
    [19] "IISExpress"                     "Larian Studios"                
    [21] "My Cheat Tables"                "My Games"                      
    [23] "mytest.R"                       "Need for Speed(TM) Payback"    
    [25] "NFS SHIFT"                      "Project CARS"                  
    [27] "README.md"                      "Rockstar Games"                
    [29] "Telltale Games"                 "testdir"                       
    [31] "The Mercury man"                "The Witcher 3"                 
    [33] "Visual Studio 2022"             "Warm Lamp Games"               
    [35] "WB Games"                       "wmd_symbol_cache"              

Check to see if “mytest.R” exists in the working directory using the
file.exists() function.

``` r
file.exists("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Access information about the file “mytest.R” by using file.info().

``` r
file.info("mytest.R")
```

             size isdir mode               mtime               ctime
    mytest.R    0 FALSE  666 2023-11-08 14:02:57 2023-11-08 14:02:57
                           atime exe
    mytest.R 2023-11-08 14:02:57  no

Change the name of the file “mytest.R” to “mytest2.R” by using
file.rename().

``` r
file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Make a copy of “mytest2.R” called “mytest3.R” using file.copy().

``` r
file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Provide the relative path to the file “mytest3.R” by using file.path().

``` r
file.path("mytest3.R")
```

    [1] "mytest3.R"

You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are
independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass
‘folder1’ and ‘folder2’ as arguments to file.path to make a
platform-independent pathname.

``` r
file.path("folder1", "folder2")
```

    [1] "folder1/folder2"

Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create
. Notice the ‘recursive’ argument. In order to create nested
directories, ‘recursive’ must be set to TRUE.

``` r
?dir.create
```

Create a directory in the current working directory called “testdir2”
and a subdirectory for it called “testdir3”, all in one command by using
dir.create() and file.path().

``` r
dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)
```

Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that
we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal
working directory at the start of these questions.)

``` r
setwd(old.dir)
```
